# Register Reference

## Register Usage

Each register may be accessed as potentially multiple data types.
This section describes the common mappings, and the semantics of each
register.

### Mappings

When registers are accessed as integer types, the following mappings
are used to encode the underlying floating point values into integer
values.

## Registers

### 0x000 - Mode

Mode: Read/write

The current operational mode of the servo.  Not all values are valid
to write.

- 0 => stopped = writeable, clears faults
- 1 => fault
- 2,3,4 => preparing to operate
- 5 => PWM mode
- 6 => voltage mode
- 7 => voltage FOC
- 8 => voltage DQ
- 9 => current
- 10 => position
- 11 => timeout
- 12 => zero velocity
- 13 => stay within
- 14 => measure inductance
- 15 => brake

When sending a command, this register must be written before any other
registers in the command frame.

### 0x001 - Position

Mode: Read only

The current position of the servo, measured in rotations of the output
shaft.  The maximum negative integer is reserved and will not be
reported.

### 0x002 - Velocity

Mode: Read only

The current velocity of the servo, measured in Hz at the output shaft.

### 0x003 - Torque

Mode: Read only

The current applied torque as measured at the output shaft.

### 0x004 - Measured Q phase current

Mode: Read only

The current in the Q phase measured in amperes.

### 0x005 - Measured D phase current

Mode: Read only

The current in the D phase measured in amperes.

### 0x006 - Measured absolution position

Mode: Read only

If an absolute encoder is configured on the ABS port, its value will
be reported here in revolutions.

### 0x007 - Measured electrical power

Mode: Read only

The estimated electrical power applied to the motor if positive.  If
negative, power applied to the DC input bus.

### 0x00a - Motor temperature

Mode: Read only

The current motor temperature, measured in degrees celsius.  This will
only be valid if an NTC thermistor is connected to the TEMP pads,
`servo.motor_thermistor_ohm` is set to the correct resistance, and
`servo.enable_motor_temperature` is set to 1.

### 0x00b - Trajectory complete

Mode: Read only

Non-zero if the current acceleration or velocity limited trajectory is
complete, and the controller is following the final velocity.

### 0x00c - Home state

Mode: Read only

* 0 - *relative only* - the position is not referenced to anything
* 1 - *rotor* - the position is referenced to the rotor
* 2 - *output* - the position has been referenced to the output,
  either with an output referenced encoder, or with a "set output
  nearest" or "set output exact" command


### 0x00d - Voltage

Mode: Read only

The current input voltage.

### 0x00e - Temperature

Mode: Read only

The current board temperature, measured in degrees celsius.

### 0x00f - Fault code

Mode: Read only

A fault code which will be set if the primary mode is 1 (Fault).

* 32 - *calibration fault* - the encoder was not able to sense a
  magnet during calibration
* 33 - *motor driver fault* - the most common reason for this is
  undervoltage, moteus attempted to draw more current than the supply
  could provide.  Other electrical faults may also report this error,
  the `drv8323` diagnostic tree has more information.
* 34 - *over voltage* - the bus voltage exceeded `servo.max_voltage`.
  This can happen due to misconfiguration, or if the controller
  regenerated power with a supply that cannot sink power and no flux
  braking was configured.
* 35 - *encoder fault* - the encoder readings are not consistent with
  a magnet being present.
* 36 - *motor not configured* - the `moteus_tool --calibrate`
  procedure has not been run on this motor.
* 37 - *pwm cycle overrun* - an internal firmware error
* 38 - *over temperature* - the maximum configured temperature has
  been exceeded
* 39 - *outside limit* - an attempt was made to start position control
  while outside the bounds configured by `servopos.position_min` and
  `servopos.position_max`.
* 40 - *under voltage* - the voltage was too low
* 41 - *config changed* - a configuration value was changed during
  operation that requires a stop
* 42 - *theta invalid* - no valid commutation encoder is available
* 43 - *position invalid* - no valid output encoder is available
* 44 - *driver enable fault* - the MOSFET gate driver could not be
  enabled
* 45 - *stop position deprecated* - an attempt was made to use the
  deprecated "stop position" feature along with velocity or
  acceleration limits.  Prefer to instead command the desired position
  directly with a target velocity of 0.0, or secondarily, disable
  acceleration and velocity limits.
* 46 - *timing violation* - internal checks are enabled, and the
  controller violated an internal timing constraint
* 47 - *bemf feedforward no accel* - `servo.bemf_feedforward` is
  configured, but no acceleration limit was specified.  If you
  *really* know what you are doing, you can disable this with
  `servo.bemf_feedforward_override`.
* 48 - *invalid limits* - `servopos.position_min` or
  `servopos.position_max` are finite and outside the available
  position range

Some non-zero codes can be presented during valid control modes
without a fault.  These indicate which, if any, function is limiting
the output power of the controller.

* 96 - `servo.max_velocity`
* 97 - `servo.max_power_W`
* 98 - the maximum system voltage
* 99 - `servo.max_current_A`
* 100 - `servo.fault_temperature`
* 101 - `servo.motor_fault_temperature`
* 102 - the commanded maximum torque
* 103 - `servopos.position_min` or `servopos.position_max`

you like burning power, with a BLDC motor you will typically want this
set to 0.  If unspecified, 0.0 is used.

### 0x1e - Voltage FOC Theta Rate

Mode: Read/write

When in Voltage Foc mode, this controls the rate of change of
electrical phase.  Integral types use the velocity mapping.


### 0x020 - Position command

Mode: Read/write

When in Position mode, this controls the desired position.

The maximally negative integer, or NaN for float represents, "use the
current position value".

If unspecified, 0.0 is used.

Note, in the absence of any configured or commanded velocity or
acceleration limits, the controller will attempt to achieve this
position *right now* subject to the kp and kd constants.

### 0x021 - Velocity command

Mode: Read/write

When in Position mode, advance the desired position at the given
velocity in Hz.

As a special case, if the 0x020 position is unset, and 0x026 stop
position is set, the sign of this is ignored, and is instead selected
so that the motor will move towards the stop position.

The maximally negative integer, or NaN for float, is treated the same
as 0.0.

If unspecified, 0.0 is used.

given factor.  Integral types are applied as for PWM.  If unspecified,
1.0 is used.

unspecified, this defaults to the system-wide configured maximum
torque.

### 0x026 - Commanded stop position

When in Position mode, and a non-zero velocity is commanded, stop
motion when reaching the given position.  NaN / maximally negative
means no limit is applied.  If unspecified, NaN is used.

Note, if the controller is ever commanded to move *away* from the stop
position, say with a velocity command that is inconsistent with the
start and stop position, then it will act as if a 0 velocity has been
commanded and the current command position equals the stop position.

### 0x027 - Watchdog timeout

Mode: Read/write

This determines the length of time for which this command is valid.
If this timeout expires before another command is received, the
controller will enter the Timeout state.  The default is 0.0, which
means to use the system-wide configured default.  NaN / maximally
negative means apply no enforced timeout.

### 0x028 - Velocity limit

Mode: Read/write

This can be used to override the global velocity limit for internally
generated trajectories.

If negative, then no limit is applied.

If unspecified, it is NaN / maximally negative, which implies to use
the global configurable default.

### 0x029 - Acceleration limit

Mode: Read/write

This can be used to override the global acceleration limit for
internally generated trajectories.

If negative, then no limit is applied.

If unspecified, it is NaN / maximally negative, which implies to use
the global configurable default.

given factor.  Integral types are applied as for PWM.  If unspecified,
1.0 is used.

### 0x02c - Fixed current override

Mode: Read/write

If specified, then the control mode will temporarily be in the "fixed
current" mode.  This is parallel to "fixed voltage" mode, but instead
of a fixed voltage, a fixed D axis current is controlled.

### 0x02d - Ignore position bounds

Mode: Read/write

If specified and non-zero, `servopos.position_min` and
`servopos.position_max` will be ignore.

control position will follow the desired limits to achieve the command
position.

### 0x040 - Stay within lower bound

Mode: Read/write

When in Stay Within mode, this controls the minimum allowable
position.  The maximally negative integer or NaN for float represents,
"there is no lower bound".  When special or the position is above this
bound (and also respecting the optional upper bound), only a
feedforward torque is applied.  When outside this bound, the PID
controller is used to force the position back to the bound.  If
unspecified, 0.0 is used.

### 0x041 - Stay within upper bound

Mode: Read/write

When in Stay Within mode, this controls the maximum allowable
position.  The maximally negative integer, or NaN for float
represents, "there is no upper bound". When special or the position is

position be re-located before control can begin.  Regardless, the
position will reset to an arbitrary value consistent with the current
encoder settings.

### 0x133 - Recapture Position and Velocity

Mode: Write only

When sent with any value, and if in "position" mode, the servo will
re-initialize the current control position and velocity to the sensed
values.  This also forces any pre-existing position integrative term
to zero.  It is expected that this will mostly be used when the
current applied torque is 0, either because of an in-place maximum
torque limit of zero, or because of an in-place kp and kd scale of
zero.

after this point will be discarded unless the devices corresponding
UUID matches what was written.

### 0x158 UUID Mask Functional
