# Quick Start Guide

New to moteus?  Work through these sections in order.  The first set
is if you have a bare board, the second is if you are starting from a
developer kit.

## Setup Overview for Bare Boards

If you have a bare moteus board and a motor, these steps are for you.

1. **[Mechanical Setup](guides/mechanical-setup.md)** - Mount the encoder magnet and controller
2. **[Electrical Setup](guides/electrical-setup.md)** - Connect phase wires and power
3. **[Software Installation](guides/software-installation.md)** - Install and run tview
4. **[Configuration](guides/configuration.md)** - Set essential parameters
5. **[Encoder Overview](guides/encoder-overview.md)** - Understand encoder options (if using external encoders)
6. **[Calibration](guides/calibration.md)** - Calibrate the controller for your motor
7. **[PID Tuning](guides/pid-tuning.md)** - Tune the position control constants
8. **[Control Modes](guides/control-modes.md)** - Learn how to control the motor

## Developer Kit Users

If you're starting from a developer kit, the motor is already mounted,
configured, calibrated and tuned. Your job is easier, yay!  Just follow these steps:

1. **[Software Installation](guides/software-installation.md)** - Install tview
2. **[Control Modes](guides/control-modes.md)** - Start controlling your motor
